    correct: 0,
    justification: "Essential goods with few substitutes have inelastic demand (PED < 1), meaning quantity demanded changes less than proportionally to price changes. PED = 0 is perfectly inelastic, and PED > 1 or infinite is more typical for non-essentials or goods with many substitutes.[6]"
