      "Salt",
      "Insulin for diabetics",
      "Movie tickets",
      "Organic apples"

    correct: 1,
    justification: "Insulin is a life-saving medication with no substitutes, so demand does not change regardless of price (PED = 0). Salt, movie tickets, and apples have substitutes or are not essential for survival."

    question: "If the price of tea increases and the demand for coffee increases, what is the cross elasticity of demand (XED) between tea and coffee?",

      "XED is negative",
      "XED is positive",
      "XED is zero",
      "XED is infinite"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    justification: "A positive XED means the two goods are substitutes: as the price of tea rises, demand for coffee increases. Complements have negative XED, unrelated goods have XED = 0."

      "YED = 1",
      "YED > 1"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    justification: "Necessities have 0 < YED < 1, meaning demand rises with income but less than proportionally. YED < 0 is for inferior goods, YED > 1 is for luxuries."

    question: "Which scenario describes a good with perfectly elastic supply (PES = ∞)?",
    code: "",
    choices: [
      "A unique painting by a famous artist",

      "Fresh strawberries during off-season",
      "Imported luxury cars"

    correct: 1,
    justification: "A mass-produced pen at a fixed price can be supplied in any quantity at that price (PES = ∞). Unique items or seasonal goods cannot."

    question: "If the PED for a product is exactly 1, what happens to total revenue when price changes?",

      "Total revenue decreases",
      "Total revenue remains unchanged",
      "Total revenue doubles"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    justification: "Unit elasticity (PED = 1) means percentage change in quantity equals percentage change in price, so total revenue remains unchanged."

    question: "Which of the following goods is most likely to have a negative income elasticity of demand (YED < 0)?",
    code: "",
    choices: [
      "Organic vegetables",
      "Public transport tickets",
      "Luxury watches",
      "Designer shoes"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    justification: "Public transport is typically an inferior good: as income rises, people may switch to private transport, reducing demand (YED < 0)."

    question: "If two goods are complements, which of the following is true about their cross elasticity of demand (XED)?",

      "XED is negative",
      "XED is zero",
      "XED is infinite"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    justification: "Complements have negative XED: an increase in the price of one leads to a decrease in demand for the other."

      "The firm will double output",
      "The firm will reduce output to zero"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    justification: "PES close to zero means supply is inelastic: firms cannot easily adjust output in response to price changes."

    question: "Which of the following is most likely to have a high price elasticity of demand (PED > 1)?",
    code: "",
    choices: [

      "Branded sports shoes",
      "Electricity",
      "Basic bread"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    justification: "Branded sports shoes have many substitutes and are non-essential, so demand is elastic (PED > 1). Tap water and bread are necessities with inelastic demand."

    question: "If the price of good A rises and the demand for good B falls, what is the likely relationship between the two goods?",
    code: "",

      "They are unrelated",
      "They are both inferior goods"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    justification: "If price of A rises and demand for B falls, A and B are complements (negative XED). Substitutes would see B's demand rise."
