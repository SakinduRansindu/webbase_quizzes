    question: "Which of the following best describes a product with a perfectly elastic demand (PED = ∞)?",
    code: "",
    choices: [
      "A unique concert ticket",
      "A product in a perfectly competitive market with many identical substitutes",
      "A patented medicine",
      "A basic food staple"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    justification: "In a perfectly competitive market, consumers will only buy at one price; any increase leads to zero demand, so PED = ∞. Unique or essential products do not have perfectly elastic demand."

    question: "If the income elasticity of demand (YED) for a product is 0.3, what does this indicate?",
    code: "",
    choices: [
      "The product is a luxury good",
      "The product is a necessity",
      "The product is an inferior good",
      "The product is a complement"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    justification: "A YED between 0 and 1 indicates a necessity: demand rises with income, but less than proportionally. Luxuries have YED > 1, and inferior goods have YED < 0."

    question: "Which of the following would most likely have a cross elasticity of demand (XED) close to zero with gasoline?",
    code: "",
    choices: [
      "Diesel fuel",
      "Car tires",
      "Bread",
      "Motor oil"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    justification: "Bread is unrelated to gasoline, so XED is close to zero. Diesel and motor oil are related goods, and car tires are complementary to gasoline."

    question: "A firm can easily increase output when prices rise. What is the likely value of its price elasticity of supply (PES)?",
    code: "",
    choices: [
      "PES < 1",
      "PES = 0",
      "PES > 1",
      "PES = 1"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    justification: "If a firm can easily increase output, supply is elastic (PES > 1). PES < 1 or PES = 0 means supply is inelastic or perfectly inelastic."

    question: "If the price of a product falls by 10% and the quantity demanded rises by 5%, what is the PED?",
    code: "",
    choices: [
      "PED = 2",
      "PED = 0.5",
      "PED = 1",
      "PED = 5"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    justification: "PED = % change in quantity demanded / % change in price = 5% / 10% = 0.5, indicating inelastic demand."

    question: "Which of the following goods is most likely to have a negative cross elasticity of demand (XED) with printers?",

    choices: [
      "Printer ink cartridges",
      "Laptops",
      "Smartphones",
      "Paper"
    ],
    correct: 0,
    justification: "Printer ink cartridges are complements to printers, so XED is negative. Laptops and smartphones are unrelated or substitutes for other products."

    question: "If a good has a YED of exactly 1, how is it classified?",
    code: "",
    choices: [
      "Necessity",
      "Luxury",
      "Unitary income elastic",
      "Inferior"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    justification: "A YED of 1 means demand changes proportionally with income: unitary income elastic. Necessities have 0 < YED < 1, luxuries YED > 1, and inferiors YED < 0."

    question: "What does a perfectly inelastic supply (PES = 0) mean for a farmer's crop in the short run?",
    code: "",
    choices: [
      "The farmer can supply any amount at any price",
      "The farmer cannot change output regardless of price",
      "The farmer will double output if price doubles",
      "The farmer will supply nothing if price falls"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    justification: "PES = 0 means output cannot be changed in response to price, typical for agricultural crops in the short run."

  {
    question: "If the price of good X increases and the demand for good Y increases, what is the relationship between X and Y?",
    code: "",
    choices: [
      "They are complements",
      "They are substitutes",
      "They are unrelated",
      "They are both inferior goods"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    justification: "If price of X increases and demand for Y increases, X and Y are substitutes (positive XED). Complements would see demand for Y fall."

    question: "Which of the following is most likely to have a low price elasticity of supply (PES < 1)?",
    code: "",
    choices: [
      "Handmade pottery",
      "T-shirts from a large factory",
      "Bottled water",
      "Mass-produced pens"
    ],
    correct: 0,
    justification: "Handmade pottery takes time and skill, so supply cannot easily increase, making PES < 1. Mass-produced goods have higher elasticity."
