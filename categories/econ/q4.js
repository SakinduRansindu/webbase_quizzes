    question: "A cinema reduces its ticket price from £8 to £7. If the price elasticity of demand (PED) is -1.6 and they originally sold 250 tickets per night, how many tickets are expected to be sold after the price change?",

    correct: 2,
    justification: "A 12.5% price decrease with PED -1.6 means a 20% increase in quantity demanded (1.6 × 12.5%). 20% of 250 is 50, so new sales = 250 + 50 = 300 tickets[1]."
