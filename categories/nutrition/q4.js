    question: "Which enzyme is responsible for breaking down lactose?",
    code: "",
    choices: [
      "Amylase",
      "Sucrase",
      "Lactase",
      "Maltase"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    justification: "Lactase specifically breaks down lactose into glucose and galactose. Deficiency of this enzyme leads to lactose intolerance."

    question: "What is the main characteristic that distinguishes amylopectin from amylose?",
    code: "",
    choices: [
      "Amylopectin is unbranched while amylose is branched",
      "Amylopectin is branched while amylose is unbranched",
      "Amylopectin contains fructose while amylose contains glucose",
      "Amylopectin is found in animals while amylose is found in plants"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    justification: "Amylopectin has a branched structure with α-1,6 glycosidic bonds at branch points, while amylose is unbranched with only α-1,4 bonds."

      "Whole wheat bread",
      "Apple juice",
      "Refined pasta"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    justification: "Whole wheat bread retains the bran and germ, providing significantly more fiber than refined products like white rice, apple juice, or refined pasta."

      "Less than 15% of total daily calories",
      "Less than 20% of total daily calories"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    justification: "Dietary guidelines recommend that added sugars should comprise less than 10% of total daily caloric intake to prevent chronic diseases."

    question: "Which type of starch is most likely to cause a rapid increase in blood glucose?",
    code: "",
    choices: [
      "Resistant starch",
      "Retrograded starch",
      "Gelatinized starch",
      "Raw starch"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    justification: "Gelatinized starch is easily digested and rapidly absorbed, causing a quick rise in blood glucose. Resistant starch is not digested in the small intestine."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the primary health concern associated with consuming high amounts of refined carbohydrates?",
    code: "",
    choices: [
      "Increased risk of type 2 diabetes",
      "Vitamin C deficiency",
      "Protein deficiency",
      "Calcium deficiency"
    ],
    correct: 0,
    justification: "High intake of refined carbohydrates is associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes due to rapid glucose spikes and insulin resistance development."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following best describes the glycemic response?",
    code: "",
    choices: [
      "The rate at which fiber is digested",
      "The blood glucose response after consuming a carbohydrate-containing food",
      "The amount of insulin produced by the pancreas",
      "The storage of glucose as glycogen"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    justification: "Glycemic response refers to the rise in blood glucose levels following consumption of carbohydrate-containing foods, measured over time."

  {
    question: "What happens to dietary fiber in the large intestine?",
    code: "",
    choices: [
      "It is completely absorbed into the bloodstream",
      "It is broken down by pancreatic enzymes",
      "It is fermented by beneficial bacteria",
      "It is converted to glucose"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    justification: "Dietary fiber is fermented by beneficial bacteria in the large intestine, producing short-chain fatty acids and supporting gut health."
