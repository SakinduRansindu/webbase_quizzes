question: "Which of the following is the only significant carbohydrate of animal origin?",
code: "",
choices: [
"Glycogen",
"Cellulose",
"Amylose",
"Starch"
],
correct: 0,
justification: "Glycogen is the stored form of carbohydrate in animals, while cellulose, amylose, and starch are primarily found in plants. This can be confusing because both glycogen and starch are storage polysaccharides, but only glycogen is found in animals."
},
{
question: "Which statement best describes amylose?",
code: "",
choices: [
"It is a branched glucose chain, easily digested",
"It is an unbranched glucose chain, resistant to digestion",
"It is a branched glucose chain, resistant to digestion",
"It is an unbranched glucose chain, easily digested"
],
correct: 1,
justification: "Amylose is an unbranched glucose chain and is resistant to digestion, making it a type of resistant starch. Amylopectin, in contrast, is branched and not resistant to digestion."

{
question: "What is the recommended dietary fiber intake for adult males?",
code: "",
choices: [
"15 g/day",
"25 g/day",
"38 g/day",
"50 g/day"
],
correct: 2,
justification: "The RDA for dietary fiber is 38 g/day for males and 25 g/day for females. The other values are common misconceptions or refer to different groups."
},
{
question: "Which of the following foods has a high glycemic index (GI > 70)?",
code: "",
choices: [
"Lentils",
"Whole Wheat Bread",
"Banana",
"Peanuts"
],
correct: 1,
justification: "Whole Wheat Bread has a GI of 71, classifying it as a high GI food. Lentils, banana, and peanuts have much lower GI values and can be confused due to their carbohydrate content."
},
{
question: "What is the main disadvantage of refining carbohydrates?",
code: "",
choices: [
"Increases dietary fiber content",
"Reduces energy intake",
"Removes fiber and micronutrients",
"Decreases palatability"
],
correct: 2,
justification: "Refining removes the bran, which contains fiber and micronutrients. This is often confused with energy content or palatability, but refining actually increases palatability and energy intake."
},
{
question: "Which of the following is NOT a function of dietary fiber?",
code: "",
choices: [
"Maintains blood glucose level",
"Reduces glycemic index of foods",
"Increases absorption of calcium and iron",
"Facilitates healthy bacteria growth in colon"
],
correct: 2,
justification: "Dietary fiber actually reduces absorption of minerals like calcium and iron, rather than increasing it. The other options are true functions of dietary fiber."
},
{
question: "Which enzyme initiates carbohydrate digestion in the human body?",
code: "",
choices: [
"Pancreatic amylase",
"Salivary alpha-amylase",
"Lactase",
"Maltase"
],
correct: 1,
justification: "Carbohydrate digestion starts in the mouth with salivary alpha-amylase. Pancreatic amylase acts later in the small intestine, while lactase and maltase act on specific sugars."
},
{
question: "Which type of carbohydrate is classified as a non-starch polysaccharide?",
code: "",
choices: [
"Amylopectin",
"Cellulose",
"Lactose",
"Glycogen"
],
correct: 1,
justification: "Cellulose is a non-starch polysaccharide, a structural component in plants. Amylopectin and glycogen are storage polysaccharides, and lactose is a disaccharide."
},
{
question: "What is the Atwater factor for carbohydrates?",
code: "",
choices: [
"4 kcal/g",
"9 kcal/g",
"7 kcal/g",
"2 kcal/g"
],
correct: 0,
justification: "The Atwater factor for carbohydrates is 4 kcal/g. Fats have 9 kcal/g, proteins 4 kcal/g, and alcohol 7 kcal/g (not listed here)."
},
{
question: "A breakfast of 450g delivers 500 kcal. What is its energy density?",
code: "",
choices: [
"1.1 kcal/g",
"2.2 kcal/g",
"3.5 kcal/g",
"0.9 kcal/g"
],
correct: 0,
justification: "Energy density is calculated as total kcal divided by total grams: 500/450 = 1.1 kcal/g. Other values are common calculation errors or refer to different examples."
