    question: "Which of the following monosaccharides is commonly found in milk sugar?",
    code: "",
    choices: [
      "Glucose",
      "Galactose",
      "Fructose",
      "Maltose"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    justification: "Galactose, together with glucose, forms lactoseâ€”the sugar found in milk. Fructose is found in fruits, and maltose is a disaccharide from starch breakdown."

    question: "Which carbohydrate is most resistant to digestion and acts as a prebiotic?",
    code: "",
    choices: [
      "Amylopectin",
      "Amylose",
      "Lactose",
      "Sucrose"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    justification: "Amylose is an unbranched glucose chain and is resistant to digestion, serving as a prebiotic. Amylopectin is branched and easily digested."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following is NOT classified as a non-starch polysaccharide?",
    code: "",
    choices: [
      "Cellulose",
      "Pectin",
      "Amylopectin",
      "Hemicellulose"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    justification: "Amylopectin is a starch polysaccharide, while cellulose, pectin, and hemicellulose are non-starch polysaccharides."

    question: "What is the main function of insoluble dietary fiber?",
    code: "",
    choices: [
      "Lowering blood cholesterol",
      "Providing bulk to feces",
      "Reducing blood glucose",
      "Fermenting in the colon"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    justification: "Insoluble fiber absorbs water and provides bulk to feces, aiding in bowel movements. Soluble fiber is responsible for fermentation and cholesterol lowering."

  {
    question: "Which of the following is a health benefit of dietary fiber?",
    code: "",
    choices: [
      "Increase energy intake",
      "Reduce glycemic index of foods",
      "Increase absorption of iron",
      "Cause hyperglycemia"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    justification: "Dietary fiber reduces the glycemic index of foods. It actually reduces energy intake and mineral absorption, and helps prevent hyperglycemia."
  },
  {
    question: "Which is a disadvantage of excessive dietary fiber intake?",
    code: "",
    choices: [
      "Increase absorption of calcium",
      "Reduce absorption of minerals",
      "Increase risk of obesity",
      "Increase energy intake"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    justification: "Excess fiber can reduce absorption of minerals like calcium and iron. It does not increase energy intake or risk of obesity."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the main advantage of refining cereals?",
    code: "",
    choices: [
      "Increase fiber content",
      "Increase palatability",
      "Increase micronutrient content",
      "Reduce shelf life"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    justification: "Refining increases palatability and shelf life, but decreases fiber and micronutrient content."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following foods has the lowest glycemic index?",
    code: "",
    choices: [
      "White bread",
      "Lentils",
      "Muesli",
      "Baked potatoes"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    justification: "Lentils have a low GI (41), while white bread, muesli, and baked potatoes have high GI values."

  {
    question: "What is the main energy source for brain cells and red blood cells?",
    code: "",
    choices: [
      "Fatty acids",
      "Amino acids",
      "Glucose",
      "Lactate"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    justification: "Glucose is the only energy source for brain cells and red blood cells under normal conditions."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following is a potential health outcome of excess carbohydrate intake?",
    code: "",
    choices: [
      "Protein energy malnutrition",
      "Obesity",
      "Anemia",
      "Scurvy"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    justification: "Excess carbohydrate intake can lead to obesity. Protein energy malnutrition is due to insufficient protein, not excess carbohydrate."
