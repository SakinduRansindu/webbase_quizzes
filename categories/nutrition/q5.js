      "Carbon",
      "Hydrogen",
      "Oxygen",
      "Nitrogen"
    ],
    correct: 3,
    justification: "Carbohydrates are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen (CH2O)n. Nitrogen is not a constituent of carbohydrates but is found in amino acids and proteins.[1][2]"

      "Glucose",
      "Sucrose",
      "Starch",
      "Fructose"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    justification: "Starch is a complex carbohydrate (polysaccharide), while glucose and fructose are monosaccharides and sucrose is a disaccharide.[1][2]"

      "Fructose",
      "Galactose",
      "Glucose",
      "Mannose"

      "Cellulose",
      "Amylose",
      "Glycogen",
      "Sucrose"
    ],
    correct: 0,
    justification: "Cellulose is a non-starch polysaccharide that provides structural support in plants and is a major component of dietary fiber.[1][2]"

    choices: [
      "Major energy source",
      "Maintain blood glucose",
      "Transport oxygen",
      "Increase satiety"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    justification: "Carbohydrates do not transport oxygen; this function is performed by hemoglobin in the blood. Carbohydrates provide energy, help maintain blood glucose, and increase satiety.[1][2]"

    question: "Which of the following foods is highest in soluble fiber?",
    code: "",
    choices: [
      "Beans",
      "White rice",
      "Chicken",
      "Refined pasta"
    ],
    correct: 0,
    justification: "Beans are rich in soluble fiber, while white rice and refined pasta are low in fiber and chicken contains none.[1][2]"

    question: "What is the main disadvantage of a diet high in refined carbohydrates?",
    code: "",
    choices: [
      "Increased fiber intake",
      "Reduced micronutrient intake",
      "Increased vitamin C",
      "Reduced shelf life"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    justification: "Refined carbohydrates have the bran and germ removed, leading to loss of fiber and micronutrients. Shelf life is actually increased.[1][2]"

    question: "Which of the following statements about amylopectin is correct?",
    code: "",
    choices: [
      "It is unbranched and resistant to digestion",
      "It is branched and easily digested",
      "It is unbranched and easily digested",
      "It is branched and resistant to digestion"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    justification: "Amylopectin is a branched polysaccharide and is not resistant to digestion, unlike amylose which is unbranched and resistant.[1][2]"

    question: "Which of the following health effects is associated with excess carbohydrate intake?",
    code: "",
    choices: [
      "Scurvy",
      "Obesity",
      "Kwashiorkor",
      "Rickets"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    justification: "Excess carbohydrate intake can lead to obesity. Scurvy, kwashiorkor, and rickets are related to other nutrient deficiencies.[1][2]"

    question: "Which calculation best describes energy density?",
    code: "",
    choices: [
      "Total grams divided by total kcal",

      "Total fiber divided by total kcal",
      "Total protein divided by total grams"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    justification: "Energy density is calculated as total kcal divided by total grams of food (e.g., 500 kcal/450g = 1.1 kcal/g).[1][2]"
